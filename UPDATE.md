- Basic caching implemented
- Regional comparison partially implemented

## Pending Optimizations
1. Core Components:
   - Cache optimization (TTL, warm-up)
   - Enhanced metrics tracking
   - Dynamic configuration
   - Performance monitoring
   
2. AI Processing:
   - Circuit breaker implementation
   - Response caching
   - Batch processing
   - Error rate tracking
   
3. Lead Analysis:
   - Feature versioning
   - Enhanced validation
   - Metric tracking
   - Performance optimization

## Next Steps
1. Implement core optimizations
2. Enhance monitoring system
3. Add performance tracking
4. Implement circuit breakers
5. Add feature versioning
6. Update validation schemas

## Technical Debt
- Cache invalidation needs improvement
