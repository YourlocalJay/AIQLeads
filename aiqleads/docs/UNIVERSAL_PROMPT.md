## Development Guidelines

### Status Tracking
```python
from aiqleads.core.project_tracking import ProjectTracker

# Initialize tracker
tracker = ProjectTracker()

# Register new component
tracker.register_component(
    component_type="api",
    component_id="api/v1/endpoints/leads.py",
    component_def={
        "purpose": "AI-driven Lead Management API",
        "functionality": ["lead_scoring", "lead_routing"]
    }
)

# Update status
tracker.update_status(
    component_id="api/v1/endpoints/leads.py",
    status="ðŸŸ¡ In Progress",
    notes="Implementing core lead scoring integration"
)

# Get status report
report = tracker.generate_report()
```

### Component Registration
- All new components must be registered through ProjectTracker
- Functionality hash prevents duplicate implementations
- Path validation ensures adherence to structure
- Status updates maintain development history

### Implementation Rules
1. Core AI Components:
   - Follow AI model integration guidelines
   - Implement monitoring hooks
   - Include performance metrics
   - Document model parameters

2. API Development:
   - Follow RESTful principles
   - Include authentication
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Add request validation

3. Data Management:
   - Use type hints
   - Implement data validation
   - Include error handling
   - Add logging

## Next Development Phase
1. Complete AI model integration
2. Implement remaining API endpoints
3. Set up comprehensive testing
4. Add monitoring dashboards
5. Optimize AI performance

## Notes
- Development continues in Optimization branch
- Focus on preventing duplicate implementations
- Maintain strict structure adherence
- Track all component statuses
