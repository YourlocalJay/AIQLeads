### Implementation Guidelines

1. File Location Rules
   ```
   AIQLeads/
   â”œâ”€â”€ backend/           # FastAPI application
   â”œâ”€â”€ ai_models/         # AI integration code
   â”œâ”€â”€ scraping/         # Data collection
   â”œâ”€â”€ services/         # External services
   â”œâ”€â”€ deployment/       # Infrastructure
   â””â”€â”€ tests/           # Test suites
   ```

2. Development Workflow
   - Validate file locations before creation
   - Update component status after changes
   - Document significant modifications
   - Include tests for new components
   - Follow security best practices

3. Critical Rules
   - Never modify core directory structure
   - Keep documentation in sync with code
   - Follow FastAPI best practices
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Maintain security standards
