## End of Chat Procedure

### Trigger
When you're ready to end the chat, type one of:
- "End of chat"
- "End chat"
- "End session"

The AI will then:
1. Run through this end-of-chat procedure
2. Generate a continuation message for your next chat
3. Format all information for easy copying

### 1. Update Project Status
Run final status check:
```python
from aiqleads.core.project_tracking import ProjectTracker
tracker = ProjectTracker()

# Update status of worked components
tracker.update_status(
    component_id="current/component/path",
    status="current_status",
    notes="End of chat status"
)

# Generate final report
final_report = tracker.generate_report()
```

### 2. Document Current State
Add to REPOSITORY_STATUS.md:
```markdown
### [Current Date]
#### Session Summary
- Completed: [List completed items]
- Current State: [State of in-progress items]
- Next Steps: [Immediate next tasks]
- Known Issues: [Any outstanding issues]

#### Next Session
- Start Point: [Component/feature to continue with]
- Priority: [Most important tasks]
- Required Setup: [Any necessary preparation]
```

### 3. Verify Documentation
Ensure all documentation is current:
- [ ] UNIVERSAL_PROMPT.md reflects latest status
- [ ] Component documentation is updated
- [ ] All changes are committed
- [ ] Next steps are clearly documented

### 4. Save Chat Context
Create a new section in REPOSITORY_STATUS.md:
```markdown
### Chat Context [Date]
- Branch: [Current branch]
- Components Modified: [List of modified components]
- Implementation Status: [Current implementation state]
- Next Session Focus: [What to focus on next]
```

### 5. Generate Continuation Message

```markdown
