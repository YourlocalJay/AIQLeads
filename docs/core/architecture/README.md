# Architecture Documentation

Welcome to the AIQLeads architecture documentation. This section provides comprehensive information about the system's architecture, design patterns, and component interactions.

## Overview

The AIQLeads architecture is designed around these key principles:
- Scalability for handling large volumes of lead data
- Reliability through robust error handling and monitoring
- Extensibility to support new data sources and features
- Security by design for sensitive data handling
