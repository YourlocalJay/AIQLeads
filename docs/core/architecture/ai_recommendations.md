# AI Recommendations Architecture

This document describes the architecture of the AI Recommendations system in AIQLeads.

## Overview
The AI Recommendations system is designed to provide intelligent lead scoring and recommendations based on historical data and real-time signals.

## System Components

### 1. Data Ingestion Pipeline
- Real-time event processing
- Historical data import
- Data validation and cleaning
- Error handling and retry logic

### 2. Feature Engineering
- User behavior analysis
- Lead quality metrics
- Market trend indicators
- Conversion likelihood factors

### 3. ML Model Service
- Model training pipeline
- Real-time inference engine
- Model versioning
- Performance monitoring

### 4. Recommendation Engine
- Score generation
- Priority ranking
- Personalization rules
- Business logic integration

### 5. API Layer
- RESTful endpoints
- GraphQL interface
- Rate limiting
- Authentication

## Data Flow
