# AI Recommendations Architecture

This document describes the architecture of the AI Recommendations system in AIQLeads.

## Overview
The AI Recommendations system is designed to provide intelligent lead scoring and recommendations based on historical data and real-time signals.

- Error handling and retry logic

### 2. Feature Engineering
- User behavior analysis ([Model Training Details](./ai_model_training.md#feature-engineering))
- Lead quality metrics
- Market trend indicators
- Conversion likelihood factors

### 3. ML Model Service

- Real-time inference engine
- Model versioning ([Version Control](./ai_model_training.md#version-control))
- Performance monitoring ([Monitoring Guide](./ai_model_training.md#performance-monitoring))

### 4. Recommendation Engine
- Score generation
- Priority ranking
- Personalization rules
- Business logic integration

### 5. API Layer
- RESTful endpoints ([API Documentation](../../api/README.md))
- GraphQL interface
- Rate limiting ([Monitoring Overview](../../implementation/monitoring/README.md#alert-configuration))
- Authentication
