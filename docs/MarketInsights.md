  - Enables agents to focus on regions with high potential returns.

### 2. **Demand Heatmaps**
- **Visualization:**
  - Highlights neighborhoods with the highest user interest and lead turnover.
  - Uses geospatial data to create demand "hot zones."
- **Use Case:**
  - Agents can quickly identify areas with increased competition or opportunity.

### 3. **Trend Analysis**

## Technical Architecture

### Data Sources
- **Scrapers:** Zillow, Craigslist, FSBO, Facebook Marketplace, LinkedIn groups.
- **APIs:** Public and private APIs from real estate platforms.
- **User Interactions:** Aggregated data from user searches, cart actions, and purchases.

### Data Flow
1. **Aggregation:**
   - Scrapers and APIs collect raw property data from multiple sources.
2. **Normalization:**
   - Data is processed through LangChain pipelines for standardization (address cleaning, price formatting, etc.).
3. **Storage:**
   - Normalized data is saved in PostgreSQL (with PostGIS for geospatial queries).
   - Aggregated metrics are stored in a dedicated `market_insights` table.
4. **Processing:**
   - Trend and demand metrics are calculated by custom scripts and stored as JSON fields in the database.
5. **Visualization:**
   - Insights are retrieved via FastAPI endpoints and visualized using frontend components (charts, heatmaps).

## Backend Components

### 1. **Market Insights Model**
- **Location:** `src/models/market_insights_model.py`
- **Fields:**
  - `region_name` (e.g., "Las Vegas, NV").
  - `median_price`, `avg_price`, `inventory_count`.
  - `price_trends` (JSON field for weekly, monthly, quarterly trends).
  - `demand_metrics` (JSON field for views, inquiries, offers).
  - `location` (geospatial point field for mapping).

### 2. **Market Insights Service**
- **Location:** `src/services/analytics_service.py`
- **Functions:**
  - Aggregates data for trend calculation (e.g., average days on market, median price changes).
  - Handles radius-based queries using PostGIS or Elasticsearch geospatial features.
  - Provides APIs for accessing processed insights.

### 3. **Market Insights Controller**
- **Location:** `src/controllers/market_insights_controller.py`
- **Endpoints:**
  - `GET /api/insights/{region}`: Retrieves market insights for a specific region.
  - `GET /api/insights/trends`: Fetches market-wide trends for comparison.
  - `GET /api/insights/demand-heatmap`: Provides demand heatmap data for visualization.

## Frontend Integration

### Features
- **Dashboard:**
  - Visualize key metrics (median prices, inventory levels) via charts.
  - Compare regional trends across selected cities.
- **Heatmaps:**
  - Interactive maps showing demand hotspots using color gradients.
- **Trend Charts:**
  - Weekly and monthly trend comparisons for pricing, inventory, and demand metrics.

### Technologies
- **Framework:** React.js with D3.js or Chart.js for visualizations.
- **Mapping:** Google Maps API or Leaflet.js for geospatial overlays.

## Testing

### Backend Tests
- **Unit Tests:** Validate aggregation and trend calculation logic in `analytics_service.py`.
- **Integration Tests:** Ensure `market_insights_controller.py` retrieves and serves accurate data.
- **Performance Tests:** Test queries on `market_insights` table for large datasets.

### Frontend Tests
- **Component Tests:** Verify chart rendering and data mapping.
- **E2E Tests:** Simulate user workflows, including filtering and heatmap interactions.
