## Deployment Process

### 1. Preparation
- Stop traffic to deployment target
- Take database backup
- Verify monitoring systems
- Alert relevant stakeholders

### 2. Deployment Steps
1. Deploy database migrations
2. Deploy application updates
3. Run automated tests
4. Verify monitoring data
5. Enable traffic gradually

### 3. Verification
- Run health checks
- Verify metrics collection
- Check error rates
- Monitor performance

## Post-deployment Tasks

### 1. Monitoring Verification
- Dashboard functionality
- Alert configurations
- Logging system
- Metrics collection

### 2. Performance Validation
- Response times
- Resource utilization
- Error rates
- Cache hit rates

### 3. User Communication
- Status updates
- Feature announcements
- Documentation updates
- Support readiness

## Rollback Procedures

### Triggers
- High error rates (>1%)
- Performance degradation (>100ms)
- Critical functionality failure
- Data inconsistency

### Process
1. Stop incoming traffic
2. Restore previous version
3. Execute database rollback
4. Verify system health
5. Resume traffic
