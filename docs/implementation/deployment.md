## Pre-deployment Checklist

### Environment Validation
- [ ] Infrastructure provisioned
    ```bash
    # Verify AWS resources
    aws ec2 describe-instances --filters "Name=tag:Environment,Values=prod"
    aws elasticache describe-cache-clusters
    aws rds describe-db-instances
    
    # Expected: All resources show 'available' status
    ```

- [ ] Network configuration verified
    ```bash
    # Test VPC connectivity
    aws ec2 describe-vpc-peering-connections
    aws ec2 describe-security-groups
    
    # Verify load balancer configuration
    aws elbv2 describe-target-groups
    aws elbv2 describe-target-health
    
    # Expected: All connections active, health checks passing
    ```

- [ ] Security groups configured
    ```bash
    # Verify security group rules
    aws ec2 describe-security-groups --group-ids sg-xxxxx
    
    # Expected: Only required ports open, proper CIDR ranges
    ```

- [ ] SSL certificates installed
    ```bash
    # Check certificate expiration
    aws acm list-certificates
    aws acm describe-certificate --certificate-arn arn:aws:acm:...
    
    # Expected: Valid certificate with >30 days until expiration
    ```

### Configuration Verification
- [ ] Environment variables set
    ```bash
    # Verify environment variables in ECS task definitions
    aws ecs describe-task-definition --task-definition aiqleads-prod
    
    # Expected: All required variables present and correctly set
    ```

- [ ] Database connections tested
    ```python
    # Test database connectivity
    python -c 'from app.core.config import settings; from app.db import engine; engine.connect()'
    
    # Expected: Connection successful, no timeout
    ```

- [ ] Cache configuration verified
    ```python
    # Test Redis connectivity and configuration
    python -c 'from app.core.cache import redis_client; redis_client.ping()'
    
    # Expected: PONG response, proper replica configuration
    ```

- [ ] Service dependencies checked
    ```bash
    # Health check all dependencies
    curl -f https://api.fireworks.ai/health
    python scripts/verify_dependencies.py
    
    # Expected: All services respond with 200 OK
    ```

### Database Migration
- [ ] Backup procedures tested
    ```bash
    # Create test backup
    python manage.py db-backup --environment=staging
    
    # Verify backup integrity
    python manage.py verify-backup latest
    
    # Expected: Backup created and verified successfully
    ```

- [ ] Migration scripts verified
    ```bash
    # Test migrations in staging
    python manage.py db upgrade --environment=staging
    
    # Verify data integrity
    python manage.py verify-migration
    
    # Expected: All migrations apply cleanly, data verified
    ```

- [ ] Rollback scripts prepared
    ```bash
    # Test rollback procedure in staging
    python manage.py db downgrade --environment=staging
    
    # Verify system functionality
    python scripts/integration_tests.py
    
    # Expected: System returns to previous state correctly
    ```

- [ ] Data integrity checks defined
    ```python
    # Run integrity checks
    python manage.py verify-data-integrity
    
    # Expected: All relationships and constraints valid
    ```

## Deployment Process

### 1. Preparation
- Stop traffic to deployment target
- Take database backup
- Verify monitoring systems
- Alert relevant stakeholders

### 2. Deployment Steps
1. Deploy database migrations
2. Deploy application updates
3. Run automated tests
4. Verify monitoring data
5. Enable traffic gradually

### 3. Verification
- Run health checks
- Verify metrics collection
- Check error rates
- Monitor performance

## Post-deployment Tasks

### 1. Monitoring Verification
- Dashboard functionality
- Alert configurations
- Logging system
- Metrics collection

### 2. Performance Validation
- Response times
- Resource utilization
- Error rates
- Cache hit rates

### 3. User Communication

- Critical functionality failure
- Data inconsistency

### Process
1. Stop incoming traffic
2. Restore previous version
3. Execute database rollback
4. Verify system health
5. Resume traffic
