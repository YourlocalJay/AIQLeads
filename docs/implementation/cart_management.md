# Cart Management System Implementation

## Overview
The cart management system implements a distributed, Redis-backed solution for handling concurrent cart operations with proper locking mechanisms and error handling.

## Technical Implementation

### Core Components
- Distributed locking using Redis
- Cart state persistence
- Concurrent operation handling
- Automatic cleanup mechanism

### Configuration
- Lock Timeout: 30 seconds
- Cart Expiration: 1 hour
- Maximum Retries: 3
- Cleanup Interval: 15 minutes

### Error Handling
- Concurrent modification detection
- Lock acquisition failures
- State inconsistency resolution
- Automatic recovery mechanisms

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Strategies
- Minimized lock duration
- Optimistic locking where applicable
- Efficient cache utilization
- Batch operations support

### Monitoring
- Lock acquisition metrics
- Cart operation latency
- Cache hit/miss ratios
- Error rate tracking
