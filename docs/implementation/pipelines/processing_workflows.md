# Processing Workflows

## Overview

AIQLeads processing workflows define the sequence of operations performed on lead data from ingestion to final storage and availability.

## Workflow Types

### 1. Lead Ingestion Workflow

    A[Raw Data] --> B[Validation]
    B --> C[Normalization]
    C --> D[Enrichment]
    D --> E[Storage]
```

- **Raw Data**: Initial lead information from various sources
- **Validation**: Schema and data quality checks
- **Normalization**: Data standardization and cleaning
- **Enrichment**: Additional data points and scoring
- **Storage**: Persistent storage with indexing

### 2. Update Workflow

- Handles updates to existing leads
- Maintains data consistency
- Triggers relevant notifications
- Updates search indices

### 3. Batch Processing Workflow

- Handles large data sets efficiently
- Implements checkpointing
- Provides progress tracking
- Manages resource allocation

## Implementation Details

### Data Validation

```javascript
const validateLead = (lead) => {
  // Schema validation
  // Data quality checks
  // Business rule validation
};
```

### Error Handling

- Each step includes error boundaries
- Failed records are queued for retry
- Error notifications are generated
- Processing stats are recorded

### Performance Considerations

1. Batch size optimization
2. Concurrent processing limits
3. Resource allocation
4. Monitoring thresholds

## Integration Points

- Input connectors
- Enrichment services
- Storage systems
- Notification services

## Monitoring

- Processing metrics
- Error rates
- Throughput stats
- Resource utilization
