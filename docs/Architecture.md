# AIQLeads Architecture

## System Components

### Rate Limiting System
- Redis-backed rate limiter with persistence
- Per-endpoint metrics and monitoring
- Real-time dashboard
- Alert system with Slack/PagerDuty integration
- Configurable thresholds and cooldowns

### Data Processing Pipeline
- Async request handling
- Parallel validation processing
- Contact information verification
- Address standardization
- Redis-based caching

### Monitoring & Metrics
- Real-time rate limit monitoring
- Error rate tracking
- Usage analytics
- Alert management
- Performance metrics

### API Integration
- Rate-limited endpoint handlers
- Error recovery mechanisms
- Retry strategies
- State persistence

## Data Flow
1. Request ingestion with rate limiting
2. Data validation and enrichment
3. State persistence in Redis
4. Metrics collection and monitoring
5. Alert triggering based on thresholds
