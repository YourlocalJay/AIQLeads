# AIQLeads - Architecture Overview

## Overview
AIQLeads is a scalable, modular real estate lead marketplace platform that leverages advanced AI, geospatial data processing, and robust infrastructure to provide high-quality leads to real estate professionals. The architecture is designed to be modular, extensible, and optimized for high performance and reliability.

## Core Architecture Components

### 1. **Frontend**
#### Features
- React-based Single Page Application (SPA) for seamless user interaction.
- Fully responsive design optimized for mobile and desktop platforms.
- Integrates with APIs exposed by the backend.
- Implements real-time notifications (e.g., cart expiration, new lead availability).

#### Technologies
- **React**: UI framework.
- **TailwindCSS**: CSS framework for responsive design.
- **Axios**: HTTP client for API interactions.
- **Socket.IO (optional)**: For real-time updates.

---

### 2. **Backend**
#### Features
- Implements all core business logic for lead management, dynamic pricing, AI recommendations, and cart handling.
- Provides RESTful API endpoints for frontend interaction.
- Handles authentication and authorization.

#### Framework
- **FastAPI**: High-performance Python framework.
- **Pydantic**: For data validation.

#### Key Components
- **API Gateway**: Rate limiting, authentication, and logging.
- **Controllers**: Route requests to appropriate services.
- **Services**: Implement business logic, including:
  - Lead marketplace service.
  - Credit system service.
  - Dynamic pricing service.
  - AI recommendations service.
  - Fraud detection and validation service.
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus and Grafana for operational visibility.

---

### 3. **Database Layer**
#### Features
- Manages persistent data storage for leads, transactions, user accounts, and analytics.
- Supports geospatial queries for location-based lead searches.
- Tracks historical trends for dynamic pricing and AI recommendations.

#### Databases
1. **PostgreSQL with PostGIS**
   - Stores primary relational data (e.g., leads, users, transactions).
   - Geospatial indexing for radius searches and heatmaps.
   
2. **Elasticsearch/OpenSearch**
   - Handles full-text search and faceted filtering.
   - Optimized for complex queries (e.g., "3-bedroom house under $300k within 5 miles of downtown").

3. **Redis**
   - Caches ephemeral data, such as cart timers and user session data.
   - Supports rate limiting and lead reservation systems.

---

### 4. **AI and Recommendation Layer**
#### Features
- Delivers personalized lead suggestions based on user preferences and behavior.
- Supports fraud detection and automated data cleaning pipelines.

#### AI Components
1. **LLM Integration**
   - **OpenAI**: Embedding generation and natural language understanding.
   - **LangChain**: For building and orchestrating AI pipelines.

2. **Vector Database**
   - **Pinecone** or **Weaviate**: Stores embeddings for leads and user profiles for similarity-based recommendations.

3. **Fraud Detection**
   - Uses heuristics and AI models to assign fraud scores to leads based on historical data patterns and anomalies.

4. **Dynamic Pricing**
   - Models adjust lead pricing dynamically based on quality score, demand metrics, and market saturation.

---

### 5. **Aggregator and Scraping System**
#### Features
- Fetches leads from platforms like Zillow, Craigslist, FSBO, LinkedIn, and Facebook Marketplace.
- Cleans and validates data before storage.

#### Pipeline
1. **Scrapers**
   - Platform-specific scrapers (e.g., `zillow_scraper.py`, `craigslist_scraper.py`).
   - Proxy rotation and rate-limiting handled via `scraper_utils.py`.

2. **Parsers**
   - Convert raw data into structured Lead objects.

3. **Pipeline**
   - Coordinates scraping, validation, fraud detection, and storage.

---

### 6. **Monitoring and Alerting**
#### Features
- Tracks operational metrics for scraping, API usage, and system health.
- Sends alerts for scraper downtime, payment issues, or system anomalies.

#### Tools
- **Prometheus**: Metrics collection.
- **Grafana**: Visualization dashboards.
- **PagerDuty/Slack**: Alerts and notifications.

---

### 7. **Security Layer**
#### Features
- Implements rate limiting, authentication, and data encryption.
- Ensures compliance with GDPR/CCPA for personal data handling.

#### Tools
- **JWT/OAuth2**: User authentication and authorization.
- **Bandit/Dependabot**: Security vulnerability scanning.
- **Encrypted Secrets**: Secure storage of API keys and credentials.

## Data Flow Diagram
1. **Scraping**
   - Scrapers fetch data from external platforms.
   - Parsers clean and normalize the data.
   - Leads are validated and stored in PostgreSQL.
   - Elasticsearch indexes data for advanced search.

2. **Frontend Requests**
   - Users request leads via API endpoints.
   - Geospatial and text search queries are processed by PostGIS and Elasticsearch.
   - Recommended leads are fetched using vector DB similarity queries.

3. **Cart Management**
   - Leads are added to a userâ€™s cart.
   - Timers are tracked using Redis.
   - Checkout deducts credits and finalizes lead purchases.

4. **Monitoring**
   - Metrics are collected and displayed in Grafana.
   - Alerts notify admins of system health or scraper failures.

## Scalability & Future Enhancements

### Scalability
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Use container orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes) to scale scrapers, API servers, and database replicas.
- **Caching**: Redis for low-latency access to frequently requested data.
- **Load Balancing**: NGINX or AWS ALB for traffic distribution.

### Future Enhancements
1. **CRM Integration**
   - Sync purchased leads directly with tools like Salesforce or HubSpot.

2. **Advanced Analytics**
   - Incorporate predictive models to identify emerging hot markets.

3. **International Markets**
   - Expand scrapers and validation pipelines for non-U.S. platforms and currencies.

4. **User Collaboration**
   - Teams can share leads or credits within the same organization.
