# AI Recommendations System Architecture

## Overview
The AI recommendations system is designed to provide personalized lead suggestions using a combination of user behavior data, market trends, and geospatial analytics. This system ensures real-time, highly relevant recommendations tailored to individual user preferences and market conditions.

## Components

### Data Pipeline
- **Feature Engineering Pipeline**
  - Analyzes user behavior and extracts actionable features.
  - Integrates real-time market data for demand and trend analysis.
  - Incorporates geospatial features such as proximity to popular neighborhoods or areas of high demand.
  - Implements feature versioning to ensure consistent updates and backward compatibility.
  - Stores processed features in a feature store for model inference.

### Model Serving
- **TensorFlow Serving Deployment**
  - Enables scalable and efficient model inference for live recommendations.
  - Supports seamless updates to models using version control.
- **API Layer with Caching**
  - Provides low-latency access to recommendation results.
  - Implements a caching mechanism to improve performance for frequent queries.
- **Load Balancing Configuration**
  - Ensures high availability and scalability under load.
  - Distributes traffic across multiple model-serving instances.
- **Model Versioning System**
  - Tracks model updates, A/B tests, and performance metrics over time.
  - Allows rollback to previous versions if necessary.

---

### Monitoring
- **Prometheus Metrics Collection**
  - Tracks system health, model performance, and API usage statistics.
- **Grafana Dashboards**
  - Visualizes key metrics like recommendation accuracy, latency, and feature drift.
- **Model Performance Tracking**
  - Monitors prediction quality, user engagement rates, and model hit/miss ratios.
- **Automated Retraining Triggers**
  - Detects feature drift or performance degradation and initiates retraining workflows.

## Implementation Timeline

### **Phase 1: Feature Engineering (Weeks 1-3)**
- Set up the data preprocessing pipeline to clean and transform raw inputs.
- Implement geospatial feature extraction (e.g., distance to market centers, neighborhood density).
- Configure the feature store for efficient storage and retrieval of processed features.

### **Phase 2: Model Development (Weeks 4-5)**
- Train the initial deep learning recommendation model using TensorFlow.
- Build an A/B testing framework to evaluate the impact of recommendations on user engagement.
- Configure a model registry for tracking versions and deployment history.

### **Phase 3: API Integration (Weeks 6-7)**
- Deploy the trained model using TensorFlow Serving.
- Add a caching layer to improve API performance.
- Set up load balancing to handle scaling and traffic distribution.

### **Phase 4: Production Deployment (Weeks 8-10)**
- Finalize and deploy monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana dashboards.
- Establish a retraining pipeline to automatically update the model as new data is collected.
- Deploy the system to production, ensuring end-to-end stability and performance.
