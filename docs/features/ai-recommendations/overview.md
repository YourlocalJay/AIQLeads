# AI-Powered Recommendations System

## Overview
The AI recommendation system **personalizes lead suggestions** based on **user behavior, market trends, and geospatial analytics**.

---

## ⚙️ **System Components**
### **1. Feature Engineering Pipeline**
✅ **User behavior analysis** - Tracks interactions (views, clicks, inquiries).  
✅ **Market data integration** - Uses historical trends to adjust lead rankings.  
✅ **Geospatial features** - Density heatmaps & demand scoring.  
✅ **Feature storage & versioning** - Ensures backward compatibility.

### **2. Model Development**
✅ **Deep learning recommendation model** (TensorFlow 2.x).  
✅ **Input features**: User history, market conditions, lead popularity.  
✅ **Output**: **Ranked lead recommendations tailored to each user**.

### **3. Model Serving**
✅ **Deployed via TensorFlow Serving**.  
✅ **Caching layer**: Redis to speed up inference requests.  
✅ **Load balancing**: Handles high user demand.  
✅ **Model versioning**: Allows A/B testing for improvement.

### **4. Monitoring & Retraining**
✅ **Prometheus Metrics**: Tracks prediction accuracy & model drift.  
✅ **Automated Retraining**: Adapts to new user behavior & market changes.
