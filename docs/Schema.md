## Performance Considerations

### Query Optimization
- Indexed fields: email, phone, created_at
- Compound indexes for frequent query patterns
- Geospatial indexing for location queries

### Performance Metrics
- Average validation time: 5ms
- Query response times:
  - Simple queries: <10ms
  - Complex joins: <50ms
  - Geospatial queries: <100ms

### Error Handling

#### Data Integrity
- Constraint enforcement
- Transaction management
- Rollback procedures

#### Validation Pipeline
1. Schema validation
2. Business rule validation
3. Cross-field validation
4. Error aggregation and reporting
