- **Action Plan**:
  - Standardize tenacity retry logic across all scrapers.
  - Integrate Prometheus metrics for request counts and durations.
  - Add geospatial validation for listings.

#### `parsers/`
- **Files**: `craigslist_parser.py`, `zillow_parser.py`, etc.
- **Current State**: Parses data but needs centralized validation.
- **Action Plan**:
  - Consolidate validation logic into `src/utils/validators.py`.
  - Add fraud scoring to parsers.

#### `pipeline.py`
- **Current State**: Coordinates scrapers and parsers.
- **Action Plan**:
  - Ensure compatibility with enhanced scraper and parser logic.
  - Add logging for each stage of the pipeline.

### `src/database/`
