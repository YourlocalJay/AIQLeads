# AIQLeads MVP - Goals and Priorities

## Overview
AIQLeads is designed to be a fully **automated, scalable, and data-driven real estate lead marketplace**, optimized for a **single operator** while providing **high-value leads** to real estate professionals.

This document outlines the **core priorities, what’s included, what’s NOT prioritized, and the guiding principles** behind the MVP.

---

## 🔥 **Core Priorities**
### **1. Automation-First Approach**
✅ **AI-powered scrapers** for Zillow, Craigslist, LinkedIn, Facebook Marketplace, FSBO.  
✅ **Dynamic pricing & fraud detection** to ensure high-quality leads.  
✅ **Automated retries & failovers** with monitoring via **Prometheus & Grafana**.  
✅ **Self-recovering architecture** to handle API failures, rate limits, and scraper updates.  

### **2. Scalable & Modular**
✅ **Microservice-ready**: Each component (scraping, pricing, recommendations) is independent.  
✅ **Cloud-native stack**: PostgreSQL + PostGIS, Redis caching, Elasticsearch, Pinecone (vector DB).  
✅ **Low infrastructure costs**: Uses **on-demand scaling** instead of fixed servers.

### **3. Data Quality & Lead Value**
✅ **AI-validated leads**: Only verified leads enter the marketplace.  
✅ **Geospatial analysis**: Location-based insights using PostGIS.  
✅ **Market insights & demand tracking**: Heatmaps, lead scarcity analysis, and more.

### **4. Revenue-Focused Features**
✅ **Subscription Tiers**:
   - Basic: Standard pricing.
   - Pro: Discounts & extended hold times.
   - Enterprise: Bulk purchases & API access.
✅ **Credit-Based Pricing**:
   - Users **purchase credits** to buy leads.
   - Prices adjust dynamically based on **lead demand & quality**.

### **5. Maintainable as a Single-Person Business**
✅ **Minimizing support overhead**:
   - Built-in health checks, alerting, and **self-healing infrastructure**.
   - **Logging & auto-reporting** for API changes or failures.
✅ **Efficient DevOps**:
   - **GitHub Actions CI/CD** to deploy updates with zero downtime.
   - **Codebase designed for minimal manual intervention**.

---

## 🚫 **What We Are NOT Prioritizing (Yet)**
❌ **Manual lead processing** - 100% automated ingestion & validation.  
❌ **Heavy staffing requirements** - Designed to scale with minimal human input.  
❌ **Custom CRM integrations** (Future roadmap, but not MVP priority).  
❌ **Over-engineered AI** - Simple but effective models focusing on ROI-driven insights.

---

## 📈 **MVP Success Criteria**
- ✅ **Leads automatically scraped, validated, and enriched with AI & geospatial data.**
- ✅ **Lead recommendations & pricing dynamically adjust based on real-time demand.**
- ✅ **100% uptime for core services through monitoring & automated recovery.**
- ✅ **At least 3 major metro areas (Las Vegas, Dallas, Austin) fully covered at launch.**
- ✅ **Marketplace generates revenue through subscription tiers & per-lead credit purchases.**

## 🎯 **Next Steps**
1. **Finalize AI-powered lead enrichment & fraud detection pipeline.**
2. **Deploy Elasticsearch-powered lead search & filtering.**
3. **Optimize dynamic pricing engine for real-time adjustments.**
4. **Integrate Prometheus/Grafana for monitoring & alerts.**
5. **Test full end-to-end user flow: Search → Cart → Purchase → Insights.**

This document will be updated as new priorities emerge based on testing and market feedback.
